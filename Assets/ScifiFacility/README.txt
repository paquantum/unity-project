Thank you for purchasing the SciFi Facility package. I hope you like it and it fits your needs.

This package uses the Universal Render Pipline. Make sure your project is set up as URP project before you import this package.
If you would like to use the HDRP create an empty HDRP Unity project and import the package found in the HDRP folder.
